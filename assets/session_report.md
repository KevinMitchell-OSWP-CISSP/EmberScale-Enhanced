## Assistant

I'll help you analyze function 000016bc. Let me start by decompiling it, then finding its callers and summarizing their purposes.

## Assistant

Interesting - the function has no direct callers shown. Let me check for cross-references to this function's address to see if it's called indirectly or through pointers:

## Assistant

Great! There are two callers at addresses 000020c0 and 000020d8. Let me find which functions these addresses belong to and analyze them:

## Assistant

Both calls appear to be from the same function. Let me find the function containing these addresses:

## Assistant

The function list shows FUN_0000212c starts at 0x0000212c, but the calls are earlier (0x000020c0, 0x000020d8). Let me search for a function that covers this range:

## Assistant

Let me try a broader range to find the function containing 0x000020c0:

## Assistant

FUN_00001eb0 with size 128 bytes would cover from 0x00001eb0 to 0x00001f30, which doesn't include 0x000020c0. Let me check if there's a larger function:

## Assistant

Perfect! FUN_00001ac0 has a size of 1008 bytes, which means it extends from 0x00001ac0 to 0x00001eb0 (1008 = 0x3f0 bytes), but that still doesn't reach 0x000020c0. Let me verify by looking at the actual function bounds:

## Assistant

FUN_00001ac0 ends at 0x00001eaf, not reaching 0x000020c0. Let me check around the caller address itself:

## Assistant

No function found in that range. This suggests the code at 0x000020c0 might be in a data region or might not be properly identified as a function. Let me check if this might be part of FUN_00001eb0 with a larger actual size:

## Assistant

FUN_00001eb0 ends at 0x00001f2f. Let me try to decompile it to understand its context and also look for what might contain 0x000020c0:

## Assistant

There's a gap in the function listings between 0x00001f30 and 0x0000212c. The code at 0x000020c0 might be inside an unlisted function or it might be code that Ghidra didn't properly identify as a function. Let me try to check what's at 0x00002000:

## Assistant

This looks like the beginning of a function starting at 0x00002000. Let me check if there's a way to find what Ghidra thinks is at this address, and also look for any strings or xrefs that might help identify the function's purpose:

## Assistant

There's a conditional jump to 0x00002058 from 0x00001e80. Let me check what function contains 0x00001e80:
