# Advanced Reverse Engineering Analysis Skill

This Skill provides specialized reverse engineering analysis capabilities for binary analysis, pattern recognition, and vulnerability assessment.

## Capabilities

### Binary Analysis
- Function analysis and classification
- String pattern recognition
- Cross-reference analysis
- Control flow analysis

### Pattern Recognition
- Malware pattern detection
- Vulnerability pattern identification
- Security feature analysis
- Code obfuscation detection

### Vulnerability Assessment
- Buffer overflow detection
- Format string vulnerability identification
- Integer overflow analysis
- Use-after-free detection

## Usage

### Basic Analysis
```python
# Analyze binary for security issues
analysis_result = analyze_binary_security(binary_data)
```

### Pattern Recognition
```python
# Detect malware patterns
malware_indicators = detect_malware_patterns(binary_data)
```

### Vulnerability Assessment
```python
# Assess vulnerabilities
vulnerabilities = assess_vulnerabilities(binary_data)
```

## Output Formats

- **Technical Reports**: Detailed analysis results
- **Risk Matrices**: Vulnerability risk assessment
- **IOC Reports**: Indicators of Compromise
- **Remediation Guides**: Security recommendations

## Configuration

### Analysis Parameters
- `sensitivity_level`: Analysis sensitivity (low, medium, high)
- `pattern_types`: Types of patterns to detect
- `output_format`: Desired output format
- `include_recommendations`: Include remediation suggestions

### Custom Patterns
- Define custom pattern recognition rules
- Configure analysis thresholds
- Set output preferences

## Examples

### Malware Analysis
```python
# Analyze binary for malware indicators
result = analyze_malware_indicators(
    binary_data=binary_data,
    sensitivity="high",
    include_network_indicators=True,
    include_file_operations=True
)
```

### Vulnerability Assessment
```python
# Assess binary for vulnerabilities
vulnerabilities = assess_binary_vulnerabilities(
    binary_data=binary_data,
    check_buffer_overflows=True,
    check_format_strings=True,
    check_integer_overflows=True
)
```

### Security Analysis
```python
# Perform comprehensive security analysis
security_report = perform_security_analysis(
    binary_data=binary_data,
    analysis_depth="comprehensive",
    include_recommendations=True
)
```
